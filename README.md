----------------------------------

A selfbot is basically a bot inside your own account. It uses your token to post messages as you. It reacts to you and you only. A token is a small piece of encrypted text. It basically is the key all Discord applications will need to connect to the account the app should run on. A selfbot can do everything you can do yourself and a little more. It can, for instance, change your or someone else’s nickname on a server you have the “Manage Nicknames” permission on. It can also be used as a sort of clipboard that posts a large text when a command is typed. Or automatically change your avatar and playing status.
But it can also do things you as a user can’t. Let’s have a look at the embed. The function to embed text is implemented in the API, likely with the reason that it’s useful for bots posting large texts. This is also due to the fact it can be formatted in a ton of different ways, for instance here.
All those possibilities are being loved by a lot of Discord consumers
